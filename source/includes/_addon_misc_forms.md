### Forms

Mautic leverages Symfony's Form component and form classes. Refer to [Symfony's documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html#creating-form-classes) for more information.

##### Form Type Configuration

As stated in Symfony's documentation referenced above, form type classes are the best way to go.  Mautic makes it easy to register form types services through the bundle's config file. Refer to the [Services](#services) section.
