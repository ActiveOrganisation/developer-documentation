### Mautic Developer Documentation ###

The developer documentation is currently a "work-in-progress" and will be made available as part of https://www.mautic.org once complete.

A work-in-progress build of the docs is available at [http://mautic.github.io/developer-documentation](http://mautic.github.io/developer-documentation).

It is generated using [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate), a great API documentation generator. The content of Mautic's documentation is located in the source/includes folder.
